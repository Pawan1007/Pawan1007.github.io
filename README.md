He taught that a negative energy always live along with a positive energy and if there is a positive energy then there must be a negative energy too. Like good - bad , north - south , positive charge - negative charge , and there are many examples of this pair but the question still remains that **"How does negative energy play important role in our life?"**. That is because a negative energy is what that motivates the positive energy, and with a negative energy in our life ( a rival ) we will be motivated too and will have a clear reason to learn and success.
