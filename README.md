He taught us important things about life and how to manage it. He taught us how to face the problems with positive attitude and told us about positive and negative energies, and that what is the importance of these energies in our life. He taught that a negative energy always live along with a positive energy and if there is a positive energy then there must be a negative energy too. Like good - bad , north - south , positive charge - negative charge , and there are many examples of this pair but the question still remains that **"How does negative energy play important role in our life?"**. That is because a negative energy is what that motivates the positive energy, and with a negative energy in our life ( a rival ) we will be motivated too and will have a clear reason to learn and success. He told us about his successful students and that how they became successful even without much recources and now he expects us to become successful with the help of the resources we have and rise the name of our college and teachers.His speech showed what does it mean to be a successful person and how should we learn about life instead of just wasting time. His speech was a great way  to motivate students through some interesting stories and some life incident of his own.
